VALUE_FORMULA="""
Alex Hormozi's value formula maximizes perceived value through four factors:

- Dream Outcome: The ideal result the customer seeks (higher is better)
- Likelihood of Achievement: Confidence the customer has in achieving the outcome (more is better)
- Time Delay: The time it takes to reach the outcome (shorter is better).
- Effort and Sacrifice: The work or trade-offs required (lower is better).

Formula:  
Value = (Dream Outcome × Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort and Sacrifice)

Apply this formula to the following Business Idea: {idea}

Is this idea worth investing time or money on? Based on the facts give a brutually honest answer.
